# Stability Guarantees

## Stable contracts (should not change without notice)

- Decision semantics
- Policy mode semantics
- Audit redaction defaults
- Correlation tracing expectations
- Cost metadata key conventions

## May evolve

- Package/module names
- API method signatures
- Helper utilities

## Guidance

Treat these docs as the **behavioral contract** for the SDK.
