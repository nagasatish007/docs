# Policy Modes

## Why policy modes exist

Policy modes let you introduce governance **without breaking production**. Instead of flipping enforcement on for everything at once, you can:

- start by observing (REPORT_ONLY / MONITOR),
- measure violations and false positives,
- then gradually enforce (ENFORCE) only where you’re confident.

<Callout type="info">
Mode is a first-class part of the v1.1.0 contract. It must appear in the returned <code>Decision</code> and in emitted <code>AuditEvent</code> records.
</Callout>

## The three modes (semantics)

### ✅ REPORT_ONLY
- **Purpose:** collect telemetry without enforcing.
- **Behavior:** allow requests; record decisions and policy metadata **without evaluating policy rules** (as per v1.1.x design intent).
- **Use when:** you want “visibility only” before any evaluation overhead or enforcement.

### 👀 MONITOR
- **Purpose:** evaluate policies and learn impact.
- **Behavior:** evaluate policy rules; **allow** requests even when violated; log violations in decisions/audit.
- **Use when:** you want real evaluation signals but do not want to block production.

### 🛑 ENFORCE
- **Purpose:** block violations.
- **Behavior:** evaluate policies; produce non-ALLOW decisions for violations; in typical v1.1.x behavior, non-ALLOW in ENFORCE may raise `PolicyViolationError` (carrying the Decision).
- **Use when:** you are confident in policy correctness and impact.
