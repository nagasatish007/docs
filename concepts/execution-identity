# Execution Identity

## Identifiers

- `correlation_id` (required): request-level correlation across components
- `trace_id` (optional): distributed tracing integration
- `span_id` / `parent_span_id` (optional): nested operation correlation (preparing for lineage)

## Context propagation

`ExecutionContext` should be propagated through TealEngine → TealGuard → TealCircuit → TealAudit.

```mermaid

  participant App
  participant Ctx
  participant Engine
  participant Audit
  App->>Ctx: createContext()
  App->>Engine: evaluate(ctx)
  Engine->>Audit: log(correlation_id)
```

## Best practices

- Generate `correlation_id` once per request/workflow entry.
- Pass `trace_id` if you already use OpenTelemetry.
