# Audit & Redaction

## Why TealTiger audits everything (safely)

TealTiger is built for **security and governance** workflows, where you need evidence of:
- what was evaluated,
- what decision was made,
- why it was made,
- and how it was enforced,

**without leaking sensitive data** (prompts, responses, secrets, PII).

In v1.1.0, TealTiger’s audit posture is:

- ✅ **Redaction by default**
- ✅ **Correlation-driven traceability**
- ✅ **Deterministic decision evidence**
- ✅ **Safe structured metadata** for cost/security reporting

<Callout type="info">
Audit logs are only useful if they are safe to retain. Redaction is not a nice-to-have — it’s the default security posture.
</Callout>
