# Decision Model

## Why a Decision contract?

TealTiger returns a single, deterministic **Decision** object from policy-enforcing components so your application can handle security and cost governance outcomes **predictably**.

A Decision is designed to be:

- **Deterministic:** same inputs + same policy → same output
- **Typed/structured:** you branch on `action` and `reason_codes`, not on strings in logs
- **Auditable:** the same decision data can be emitted to `AuditEvent`
- **Composable:** engine/guard/circuit all return the same structure

<Callout type="info">
Think of a Decision as a **policy result** plus **how your app should react** (block, allow, redact, transform, require approval, degrade).
</Callout>
