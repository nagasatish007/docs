> This page documents behavior guaranteed in TealTiger v1.1.0. Final API names may evolve, but the **policy evaluation semantics** are stable.

# Policy Overview

## What is a policy?

A **policy** is a deterministic set of rules that evaluates a request context and produces a **Decision**:

- `action`: ALLOW / DENY / REQUIRE_APPROVAL / REDACT / TRANSFORM / DEGRADE
- `reason_codes`: stable identifiers explaining why
- `risk_score`: 0–100

Policies exist so you can enforce **security and cost governance** consistently across agent workflows.

## Where policies run

TealTiger is **SDK-only** in v1.1.0 — policies run inside your application process.
