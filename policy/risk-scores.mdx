# Risk Scores

## What is `risk_score`?

`risk_score` is a numeric severity signal in the range **0–100** returned with every Decision.

- **0** → no meaningful risk  
- **100** → critical risk

Risk score complements **Decision.action** and **reason_codes**:

- **Action** → what to do  
- **Reason codes** → why  
- **Risk score** → how severe / how urgent  

<Callout type="info">
Branch on <code>Decision.action</code> and <code>Decision.reason_codes</code>. Use <code>risk_score</code> for routing, escalation, and prioritization.
</Callout>

## Recommended thresholds (starter defaults)

These thresholds are practical defaults you can tune over time:

- **≥ 80** → escalate / require approval / block (depending on mode)
- **50–79** → warn, add stronger logging, limit capabilities
- **< 50** → proceed with normal logging

<RequestExample>
```text title="Risk routing (pseudo)"
function routeByRisk(decision) {
  if (decision.risk_score >= 80) return "ESCALATE";
  if (decision.risk_score >= 50) return "WARN";
  return "NORMAL";
}
