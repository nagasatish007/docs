# Conditions & Actions

## Mental model

Policies follow a simple rule:

**IF** a condition matches the request context  
**THEN** emit a deterministic Decision (action + reason codes + risk score)

- **Conditions** decide *when* a rule triggers
- **Actions** decide *how* the system should respond
- **Reason codes** explain *why*
- **Risk score** indicates *severity*

---

## Common condition patterns

### Tool governance
- Tool name is disallowed
- Tool used outside approved environment
- Tool invoked with unsafe parameters

### Environment gating
- `env == production` AND destructive action
- Non-prod behaviors allowed, prod restricted

### Identity / tenant scoping
- Tenant not authorized for model or tool
- App or agent purpose outside allowed scope

### Content & classification
- PII detected
- Secrets detected
- Unsafe or malicious content classification

### Cost signals (when available)
- Estimated cost exceeds threshold
- Budget exceeded
- Model tier not allowed

## Decision actions (v1.1.0)

### ALLOW
Proceed with the request. Still log the decision.

### DENY
Block the request. In ENFORCE mode, typically raises a policy violation error.

### REQUIRE_APPROVAL
Pause execution and require external approval (human or system).

### REDACT
Remove sensitive fragments and proceed with sanitized content.

### TRANSFORM
Modify the request or response before continuing (e.g., schema enforcement, truncation).

### DEGRADE
Proceed with reduced capability (cheaper model, fewer tools, limited output).

<Callout type="info">
TealTiger produces the Decision. Your application applies the action.
</Callout>

## Example: tool allow/deny policy (illustrative)

<RequestExample>
```json title="RequestContext"
{
  "action": "tool.execute",
  "tool": "file_delete",
  "context": {
    "env": "production",
    "tenant_id": "acme-corp"
  }
}
